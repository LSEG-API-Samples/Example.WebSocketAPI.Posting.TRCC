    "# Contributing your data to Real-Time Platform with WebSocket API and Real-Time Distribution System using Contribution Channel\n",
    "\n",
    "- Last update: October 2025\n",
    "- Environment: Windows and Linux OS \n",
    "- Compiler: Python\n",
    "- Prerequisite: Real-Time Distribution servers version 3.2.1 and above, RCC Access Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "## RCC Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Contribution Channel (RCC) is a new service for on-boarding content to LSEG Real-Time. Depending on the client's needs, access to the service will be fulfilled by one or more of the following products: Contributions Channel for the Real-Time Advanced Distribution Server/Advanced Data Hub Server, Contributions Channel for Real-Time API, Contributions Channel for Spreadsheet. RCC aims for replacing the legacy Market Link IP (MLIP) system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Contribution is a means to send your pricing data directly to Real-Time Platform , from where it can fan out globally. Leading market participants, such as banks and brokers, use Real-Time platform to publish and distribute their information to the community of financial professions, in order to advertise their prices to clients and prospects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to writing an application to contribute your data to RCC using [Websocket API for Pricing Streaming and Real-Time Service](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-real-time-opnsrc/refinitiv-websocket-api) (aka WebSocket API) through Real-Time Distribution System (Real-Time Advanced Distribution and Advanced Data Hub servers).. The example just connects to Real-Time Advanced Distribution Server via a WebSocket connection, then sends an off-stream post to contribute item to RCC server via that Real-Time Distribution System. The project are implemented with Python language for both console and Jupyter Notebook applications, but the main concept and post message structures are the same for all technologies. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested to contribute data using the RSSL connection (with or without Real-Time Distribution System), please visit the following series of Real-Time SDK and RCC based on your prefer API: \n",

    "\n",
    "*Note:* In an off-stream post, the client application can send a post for an item via a Login stream, regardless of whether a data stream first exists. The route of the post is determined by the Refinitiv Real-Time Distribution System configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contribution Setups\n",
    "\n",
    "*Update (As of October 2025)**: The direct Websocket access to Contributions Channel Tutorials are available here:\n",

    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is focusing on **the second method** which is contributing data via  Real-Time Distribution System servers (Real-Time Advanced Distribution and Advanced Data Hub servers).
